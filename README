This code is intended to be a basis for an implementation of a paper that I am working on. The paper aims to propose theories needed to have an automated policy insertion and verification method for ML.
This project is a compiler for a simple variant of ML language.
The paper, the code, the documentation, credits (the initial code is from ocaml: http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/u3-ocaml/ocaml-ml.html ) and necessary open source license will be completed in time!

Hope you enjoy this and find it useful!
